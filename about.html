            Greetings everyone! I'm a front-end web developer and lifelong learner
            currently enrolled in CodeLouisville. I'm also learning backend web development
            on TeamTreeHouse.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2015, I recieved my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from EKU with an intention
            to go to Med school. In addition, I have two Associate Degrees - Art and Science - from
            Big Sandy College Community and Technical College(2013). Before that I studied pharmacy abroad
            for one year in Syria during 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, in 2016 I did some deep soul searching and decided to become a developer
            because I was introduced to web development during my childhood years and Iâ€™ve always
            been fascinated by it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Back in 2004 when I was 11 years old, my dad's friend showed me how
            to make a simple website using Microsoft FrontPage.
            The first HTML element I wrote was
            <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>.
            I thought that was the coolest thing ever!
            He also showed me how to host it to Angelfire.
            I also liked blogging on Wordpress and testing
            plugins when I was in high school. I believe that if you enjoy doing something
            not only will time fly but you will stay up late, wake up early, and forget to eat.
